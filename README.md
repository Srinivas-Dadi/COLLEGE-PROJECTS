# COLLEGE-PROJECTS
Web pages created during my education


This is just a front end responsive website developed by me and my friends as a mini project in out educational institute

Motto-
      No pandemic can stop or effect craftesmen who create traditional crafts which express out tradion to the people. This website reduces the gap between the people 
      who are intrested and looking for genune products.This also helps the craftsmen to sale their products through out the country.Due to this there is no wait of
      festival seasons or touristic period.Their business will be happening throughout the year.
